* Dragan Djuric: Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU
** parallelization suitability
*** map: can be well parallelized :-)
*** redure: difficult to parallelize :-(
** ClojureCL / OpenCL - "Hello World" ~ 170 LoC
** Bayadera (Bayesian) - very fast
   Bayesian is hard to compute, multi model, many dimensional problem, complex hyperspace
   Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC) - difficult to parallelize
** JAGS/Stan (state-of-the-art bayesian C++ tools)

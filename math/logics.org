  In logic: terms encode proofs, In programming: terms are programming language
** a.k.a Traditional a.k.a Constructive Logic: endless resources, no need for construction / descruction

* Embedding intuitionistic logic into linear logic
  A → B = !A ⊸ B
  A × B = A & B    alternativelly A × B = !A ⊗ !B
  A + B = !A ⊕ !B
 
* Propositional Logic: AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN, IS-EQUIVALENT-TO
* Predicate Logic: dependence on free variables, has Universal quantifiers, variables, functions
* Higher order logic

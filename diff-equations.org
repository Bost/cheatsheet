- solution of a Differential Equations (DE) is a function, not value.

* Nash Equilibrum (NE):
- each players best response to the others
- nobody has an incentive to deviate from their actions if an equilibrum is played

* TODO
1. write down action profiles for everyone (the matrix) and calculate optimal mixed strategies for everyone in order to get NE
2. Calculate maxmin strategy and maxmin value (i.e. when the other guys do max harm the i-guy)
** games beyond 2x2 (See the 2-4 Hardness lecture):
   Linear Complementarity formulation
   Support Enumeration Method



Goldbach conjencture: Every even integer >=2 is a sum of two primes
Riemann hypothesis: The real part of every non-trivila zero of the Zeta function is 1/2
Poincare conjencture: Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorfic to the 3-sphere (Donuts)
P vs. NP: Every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer?
Fermant's Last Thm: For all n>=2 there's no x,y,z that x^n + y^n = z^n

Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes

- solution of a Differential Equations (DE) is a function, not value.

* Nash Equilibrum (NE):
- each players best response to the others
- nobody has an incentive to deviate from their actions if an equilibrum is played

* TODO
1. write down action profiles for everyone (the matrix) and calculate optimal mixed strategies for everyone in order to get NE
2. Calculate maxmin strategy and maxmin value (i.e. when the other guys do max harm the i-guy)
** games beyond 2x2 (See the 2-4 Hardness lecture):
   Linear Complementarity formulation
   Support Enumeration Method

* Eric Weinstein: Machine learning with Clojure and Apache Stark
** Machine learning
** Apache Spark:
*** Supervised learning, Generalization
*** Classification or regression, generalizing from labeled to unlabeled data
*** cluster computing framework - ideal for large data sets
**** RDD Resilient Distrib Dataset
**** Datase: RDD + Spark SQL execution engine
**** DataFrame: dataset ordanized into named columns

* http://bit.ly/2f9jVwn - LA police stop data, 600.000
* Decision Trees (binary classifier) robust in noise; good for binary
* no free lunch - no universal approach

* Racist data leads to racist machines - bias problem

* What's Deep learning
** neural networks - computational architecture modeled after brain
*** many layers
*** vanishing/exploding gradient problem
** Vanishing && Exploding Gradients
** Convolutional networks; stacks of feature maps
** Max Pooling / Downsampling
** Alternating Layers

* Tale of two DSLs: Flambo vs. Sparkling
** 1. Flambo
** 2. Sparkling
** DL4J - Deep Learning 4 Java

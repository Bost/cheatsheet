Byzantine Fault Tolerances / Consensus methods:
https://link.medium.com/V2dglrC5UU
- distributed systems with imperfect information if a component failed
Proof of Work - used by Bitcoin
Proof of Stake
Proof of activity
Proof of burn
Proof of capacity

BGP - The Byzantine Generals Problem:
A groupf generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or
retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive.
Some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision.

PoW (Proof of Work)
- Consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin i.e. a solution of the BGP
- Cost of registration, investing a scarce resource - electricity used to solve a math (arbitrary) puzzle creates trust
- election of a leader - randomized, one CPU = one vote
- mining pools - decrease randomisation, unwanted centralisation

PoS (Proof of Stake) - cardano
cardano + foundation
The currency itself is the scare resource
each time slot, randomly pick one coin, it's owner produces a block
different leader selection - weighted by stake, the more coins you have the higher chance of getting elected for the next block
holder of a large amount of coins has a better chance of attacking the system - if people notice the currency gets devaluated -> this forces you to play honest?
SRSLY??? Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi
Explicit decentralized & unpredictable randomness generator everybody agrees on
Ouroboros protocol - has a proof of security
Ouroboros
- split time into slots, each slot will have a block, a stakeholder is elected for a slot leader and has a right to create a new block
- slots grouped into an epoch, before the start of an epoch all stakeholder have to agree on some seed for the next random generator
- private dice roll, the send a proof of "the dice is cast" to the bchain, then the rand numers and combined and the seed is created
- ouroboros protocol is proven to for participants having less than a half of the stake (all ADA coins)
Ouroboros Praos - Ouroboros extention: What happens if messages are delayed
Proof written in Haskell
Process Calculi - model of distributed systems modeled in terms of runnable processes comunicating via channels
measurement of process similarity or interchangeability, observational equivalence, equational reasoning, bisimilarity
compositional language
Process Calculi: examples: CCS, CSP, ACP, Ï€ - calculus
Psi Calculus
